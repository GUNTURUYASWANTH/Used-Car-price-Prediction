# Used-Car-price-Prediction
Used car price prediction is a system in which it gives exact price of Cars to the buyer and  seller.

ABSTRACT:
Everyone has a dream to buy a new car. But they cannot afford to buy a new car at that time he wants to buy a used cars. They do not have a knowledge to predict the price of a car. At that time this project will be helpful to predict the car selling price based on their features like the car model, the number of years that a car is old, the type of fuel it uses, the type of seller, the type of transmission and the number of kilometers that the car has driven so far. This project will help to get an approximation about selling price of a used car based on its features and reduces the seller and consumer risk in business. The proposed model utilizes the machine learning algorithms and regression techniques of statistics decision tree, XG boost and random forest regressions to achieve this task.

PROBLEM-STATEMENT:
The main aim of this project is to predict the price of used cars using the Machine Learning (ML) models. This can enable the customers to make decisions based on different attributes and features namely
• Brand or Type of the car one prefers like Ford, Hyundai
• Model of the car namely Ford Figo, Hyundai Creta
• Year of manufacturing like 2020, 2021,2022
• Type of fuel namely Petrol, Diesel
• Price range or Budget
• Type of transmission which the customer prefers like Automatic or Manual
• Mileage

TOOLS AND PLATFORM:
HTML: HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g.: HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a web page should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.
Flask: Flask is a lightweight and versatile web framework for Python, designed to simplify the development of web applications. Known for its simplicity and modularity, Flask provides essential tools and libraries, allowing developers to build scalable and efficient web solutions. With its minimalist design, Flask empowers developers to choose and integrate components as needed, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced developers seeking flexibility and ease of use in web application development.
Python: Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that is widely used in various fields, including data science, machine learning, web development, and automation. The simplicity of Python allows for faster development and easier maintenance of code. Python is open source, allowing developers to contribute to the language's development and benefit from a wealth of open-source libraries and tools. NumPy and Pandas provides Essential for data manipulation and analysis. Scikit-learn Provides a simple and efficient tool for data mining and data ana
